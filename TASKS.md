## Measured verification
- [x] Backend build/migrations/generation;6 automated backend/security/origin/rate-limit tests passed.
- [x] Admin authenticated browser blog CRUD/schedule/SEO/statistics and API CRUD across8 resources, media upload/alt update; temporary data cleaned.
- [x] Frontend content-safety tests9/9; TypeScript and lint pass after integration edits.
- [x] Frontend and backend production dependency audits:0 known vulnerabilities in measured runs.
- [x]1182/1182 asset HTTP checks passed.
- [x] Final integrated production build after last focused fixes (180 generated pages, TypeScript included).
- [x] Final full route/link/SEO/responsive/axe browser run:173 routes,183 links,6×11 major views,3 mobile blogs,4 axe scopes; zero findings.
- [x] Final public interaction suite19/19 PASS, including59-plan service/billing filters and a390px actual booking receipt rerun; temporary-data cleanup PASS.
- [x] Actual business-settings tagline/global SEO propagation and source-default restoration after ISR; temporary settings removed.
- [x] Lighthouse mobile lab measurement and bounded optimization, with all experiments restored to a full-content build.
- [ ] Local performance acceptance remains unmet:final home80/LCP3.161s, coworking87/LCP3.156s; targets90+/LCP<2.5s.
- [x] Final checkpoint/status and parent notification; own locks released. Open local performance acceptance remains pending.

## External, not authorized/executable as live actions
- [ ] Supply business-approved privacy policy and terms (source link lacks policy document).
- [ ] Configure/approve SMTP sender and perform authorized live delivery test.
- [ ] Configure third-party booking/membership/payment credentials only if replacement is approved; do not enable payment collection.
- [ ] Approve hosting/cutover, production secrets, domain/TLS, backups and staging validation before live deployment.
- [ ] Measure real-device/field Core Web Vitals after approved staging/deployment; no field INP claim from Lighthouse.

- [x] 28 Oct09:08UTC: authentic AVIF-first candidate built/measured/repeated, no demonstrated improvement; reverted exactly; restored types/lint/safety9/9 pass.
- [ ] Stabilize serial same-origin full-content mobile baseline; improve actual homepage LCP without removing content. Latest restored85/LCP3.430s not accepted.

- [x] 28 Oct guarded serial full-content baseline10 valid samples, reusable QA harness and8/8 refusal tests; durable PERFORMANCE_PROFILE.md.
- [ ] Profile fast/slow hero decode/paint versus document Layout/runtime, then test a justified isolated optimization with repeated measurements. Home median LCP2.968s remains unmet.


## Paint/presentation continuation 2026-10-28T12:09:26.804Z
Continuation o80BOMQUyNE9X1Km retained QA code/docs only: scripts/qa/paint-timeline.mjs, its eight-test suite, npm test:paint-timeline and README guidance. No app/components/lib/CSS/Next config/dependency or DB changes. TypeScript, app lint, frontend safety9/9, baseline guards8/8 and paint tests8/8 PASS1194; CLI first write succeeds and overwrite is refused with original evidence intact. No new build/full functional-regression claim.

Fresh unchanged full-content baseline1192: three valid samples per route. Home performance82–91/median91, LCP2.948–3.010s/median2.988s, TBT218–402ms/median223. Coworking performance92–96/median93, LCP2.119–2.272s/median2.265s, TBT202–303ms/median259. All6 A11y/BP/SEO100, zero console errors, CLS<0.001. Exit1 because home LCP misses target in all3. Prior frozen functional evidence is unchanged.

Raw-trace correlation: prior fast4-home paints hero217.605ms and records LCP243.459ms (gap25.854ms); slow2/3/5 gaps969–999ms, with672–693ms outside recorded main-thread RunTask intervals. Fresh samples2/3 have1007–1009ms gaps;988/737ms respectively outside recorded tasks. This does NOT identify a compositor/GPU/OS/paint-holding cause, prove a browser defect, or replace simulated Lighthouse LCP. Decode Image events lack node/URL attribution; do not label them proven hero decodes.

Separate fresh-Chrome A/B diagnostic1193: A=unchanged launcher defaults; B=only remove RenderDocument from launcher disabled-feature list, every other default retained. Order AB/BA/AB. A performance82/87/90, LCP3.027/3.007/3.007s; B86/76/78, LCP2.995/2.990/3.034s. All6 valid, other scores100; no meaningful LCP benefit. No browser flags/thresholds changed in canonical runners. Related upstream issue17148 is a hypothesis, not local root-cause proof.

Evidence:C:/Users/Abdul Moid/.aside/u/0/sessions/2026-10-28_o80BOMQUyNE9X1Km/tmp/baseline (6 report/trace pairs), renderdocument-diagnostic (6 pairs+summary), paint-correlation-summary.json, validation-summary.json. Durable PAINT_PROFILE.md summarizes exact scope and next steps. Local frontend1190TTY3100/.next-qa and API1191TTY4000 restarted with explicit QA CORS; final browser snapshot verifies pricing and original disclosure. Direct Aside screenshots timed out twice; baseline/3-home final Lighthouse screenshot saved as measured-home-final.jpg, with content subsequently reverified, not a new screenshot.

Next:targeted cc/viz + frame-sink correlation and/or identical headful-vs-headless control before another product refactor. Preserve canonical failing baseline; do not repeatedly try RenderDocument/AVIF/server-shell candidates or claim acceptance from altered browser settings. Still IN PROGRESS for LOCAL performance, NOT WAITING_EXTERNAL. External legal/pricing review, approved SMTP/delivery, providers, deployment/infra and field-performance inputs remain unchanged. No live writes/accounts/payments/billing/secrets.

## Autonomous API/UI audit 2026-10-29
- [x] Explicit DTO validation and oversized JSON fix; focused20-pass cycles verified.
- [x] Booking/modal/Lenis/admin-overflow repairs with scoped real-browser verification.
- [x] Add398-scenario resumable runner and guard/booking/dev-startup tests; full run in progress.
- [ ] Finish all20-pass API scenarios plus supplemental attack-vector coverage; verify marker cleanup.
- [ ] Run complete imported-route8-width layout/admin/dialog regression and fix findings.
- [ ] Complete Prisma generation/migration, types/lint, clean builds and API/public/browser/settings suites.
- [ ] Final measured report only after all local gates; preserve external approvals.


## Button reachability + text update (29 Oct 2026)
- Changed pricing card button label from "Ask about this plan" to "Book now" in `components/pricing-grid.tsx`.
- Fixed hit-area reachability: added `cursor: pointer !important; pointer-events: auto !important; position: relative !important; z-index: 10 !important; transform: translateZ(20px);` to `.price-card .btn`, and `pointer-events: none !important;` to child elements so mouse clicks anywhere on the button box (including padding and empty space, not just text/arrow) reach the button directly and display the pointer hand. Tested and verified at all 7 points across the button box.
- All 57 pure tests, typecheck, and lint pass clean with 0 errors.


## Merged booking steps 2 & 3 and notice removal (29 Oct 2026)
- Removed notice paragraph "You'll securely pay to confirm this booking on the next screen. We use Stripe for payment processing; your card details are never stored on our servers." from `components/booking-dialog.tsx`.
- Merged step 2 (Plan) and step 3 (Plan Details) into a single 5-step flow:
  1. Choose Workspace (Step 1 of 5)
  2. Select Plan (Step 2 of 5 - "Plan & Details"): clicking any plan card dynamically reveals that plan's details, description, price, and included amenities directly beneath the grid in an animated card (`.bk-plan-details-box`).
  3. Add-ons (Step 3 of 5)
  4. Date & Time (Step 4 of 5)
  5. Review & Pay (Step 5 of 5)
- Forward and backward navigation verified across all 5 steps; Escape dismisses; 57/57 pure tests, typecheck, lint, and backend build pass clean with zero errors.


## Calendar alignment and container redesign (29 Oct 2026)
- Diagnosed root causes of calendar layout and misalignment:
  1. Month navigation header (`.bk-cal-nav`) stretched to full dialog width (617px), while dates grid was capped in the center, causing `<` and `>` buttons to float at the far edges of the modal.
  2. Unbounded grid width caused column mismatch and wide gaps between date numbers compared to day-name headers.
  3. Time slots were full-width (617px) directly under a narrow grid, creating a funnel effect.
- Redesigned into a unified, framed calendar card (`.bk-cal-card`):
  - Fixed `max-width: 380px; margin: 0 auto 20px;` so navigation, weekday labels, and date columns share the exact same width and boundaries.
  - Previous/next buttons are compact (34×34px) and snug on both sides of the month title directly above the calendar columns.
  - Weekday labels (`SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA`) and 38×38px circular date pills are pixel-aligned with a clean 7-column grid.
  - Today date has an amber ring; selected date is an elevated dark circular pill.
  - Time slots placed in a centered `.bk-time-section` (4 columns on desktop, 3 columns on mobile) so all 12 slots form completely filled rows with no dangling slots.
  - Heading updated to clean "Select preferred time".
- Verified on desktop (1280px) and mobile (390px): zero overflow, zero clipping, perfect alignment.
- All 57 pure tests, TypeScript typecheck, and ESLint pass with zero errors.


## LOCAL audit safety continuation, 29 Oct2026 17:09UTC
- [x] Reconcile stopped v3/v4 and stale canonical ownership; preserve historical reports, no overlapping suites.
- [x] Fix Stripe webhook processing errors falsely returning200; actual controller/signature pure regressions4/4 PASS. Concurrent/email exactly-once remains unproved.
- [x] Fail closed before mutation suites when external Stripe secrets configured, including test keys; safety tests3/3 and real CLI preflight refusals verified.
- [x] Repair aggregate pure guard registration:64/64 tests PASS and backend compile PASS exec1132.
- [x] Capture mobile-menu opening trigger for cleanup focus restoration instead of reading a possibly changed ref; final types/lint exec1136 both PASS, no reported warnings/errors. Browser focus regression still not executed.
- [ ] Establish current compiled API readiness/CORS without interfering with unknown4000 service; owned4001 startup timed out twice and was stopped.
- [ ] Provide isolated LOCAL payment transport/current-schema booking scenario fixtures, no external Stripe calls; restart398x20 in fresh absolute QA_TMP, preserve all old evidence.
- [ ] Only after current full PASS+cleanup run153 companion,8-width all-route/manual44px layout, final build/Prisma/API/public/browser/settings/performance gates. No complete-audit claim.


## LOCAL isolated-payment continuation 2026-10-29T17:27:11.518Z
- [x] QA-only isolated payment provider/application and current398-scenario booking contract; production provider unchanged.
- [x]73/73 pure regressions and backend compile PASS; in-process health/CORS/identity/source20/20 PASS.
- [x] Fail-closed runtime/source checks and companion current-source predecessor check; prevent Prisma dotenv provider inheritance before import.
- [ ] ACTIVE fresh v6 main exec1009TTY, session kQQ2UnfOX9BLdgGg, 16/39820/20 at checkpoint. See latest API_STRESS_AUDIT.md; monitor only, no competing source edits/build/crawl/mutations.
- [ ] Full398+final cleanup,153 companion,8-width layout/manual review and remaining final gates still required; current5-step public checkout assertions still need adaptation AFTER main cleanup.


## Latest LOCAL v6 recovery, 2026-10-29T17:49:25.572Z
Status remains IN PROGRESS. Current SAME-SOURCE v6 main is ACTIVE in session b1E36eB9wohpP02g, exec1012TTY, PID29652, isolated API and runner in one process. Same report: C:/Users/Abdul Moid/.aside/u/0/sessions/2026-10-29_kQQ2UnfOX9BLdgGg/tmp/api-scenarios-v6-local/api-scenarios.json. Checkpoint 124/398 at20/20, 2492 passing iterations, 1 retained failure (interrupted/unconfirmed attempt, not a proven endpoint error); current admin.popups.validation. Re-read actual report/lock before action. No competing runtime/runner edits, builds, mutation suites or crawls.
- Previous exec1009 tool session expired at119/398 and2380passes/0fail during a429 wait; report last updated17:37:51Z. Explicit Get-Process confirmed PID26972 absent; port4001 listener count0. Canonical ownership acquired only after parent/root/specialists checked idle; no existing worker killed.
- Before restart: source and runner fingerprint matched exactly. Marker-only independent cleanup twice PASS, all five owned table counts0; original report/lock preserved in this session tmp/v6-interrupted-original.json and v6-interrupted-lock.txt. Kept current iteration so --resume honestly records INTERRUPTED_UNCONFIRMED and restarts its20-pass streak. That scenario (public.popups.detail.valid) subsequently reached20/20. No source/runtime changes or threshold changes.
- First recovery startup exec1011 lacked the required pre-created readiness output directory (ENOENT); stopped only that owned API, no main execution occurred. Created fresh readiness directory and restarted exec1012 --resume. Actual in-process readiness20/20 PASS: health200/statusok,3100 CORS, runtime/local-payment/source identity. Evidence: this session tmp/readiness-v6-resume-2/local-payment-readiness.json and v6-resume-checkpoint.json.
- Next: monitor current report; tool processes can expire. If stopped, prove liveness/port absence and reconcile matching marker/lock before matching-source --resume. Pre-create QA_READINESS_TMP (readiness writer does not mkdir). Never resume after a fingerprint change. Companion153 and all layout/final gates still blocked until full398PASS+final cleanup+no runner lock. No external calls, user-record deletion, seeding or live changes. Canonical editing lock released at handoff; main runner lock intentionally retained.


## Latest LOCAL v6 second recovery, 2026-10-29T18:02:56.253Z
Status remains IN PROGRESS. SAME-SOURCE v6 main resumed in session lpvshEqaclInHbaS, exec1013TTY, PID34404; isolated API and runner share one process. Report: C:\Users\Abdul Moid\.aside\u\0\sessions\2026-10-29_kQQ2UnfOX9BLdgGg\tmp\api-scenarios-v6-local\api-scenarios.json. Checkpoint: 227/398 scenarios at20/20, 4540 passing iterations and 2 retained failures from interrupted/unconfirmed attempts, not proven endpoint defects. Current public.mailbox.detail.valid; fresh counts must be read from JSON. No competing source edits/build/crawl/companion or mutation suites.
- exec1012 expired at214/398,4280passes/1prior interruption, with an unconfirmed POST to /admin/business-address. Tool SESSION_NOT_FOUND plus Get-Process PID29652 absent and port4001 listener count0 confirmed it stopped. Parent/root/specialists idle before canonical ownership acquired. No unknown process killed.
- Exact source and runner fingerprints matched. Marker-only reconciliation twice PASS, all five owned table counts0. Original report/lock preserved in this session tmp/v6-interrupted-original.json and v6-interrupted-lock.txt. Resume recorded a second INTERRUPTED_UNCONFIRMED and reset that scenario's20-cycle. No runtime/runner sources or thresholds changed.
- Fresh in-process readiness20/20 PASS (health200/statusok, localhost3100 CORS, matching runtime/local-fixture/source identity). Evidence: this session tmp/readiness-v6-resume/local-payment-readiness.json and v6-resume-checkpoint.json. QA_READINESS_TMP pre-created. No cross-tool/browser connectivity acceptance claim.
- Next: monitor exact report and liveness; if stopped, reconcile matching marker/lock/fingerprint before --resume. Supplemental153, layout and all final gates remain blocked until full398PASS + final cleanupPASS + no runner lock. No external provider/mail calls, seeds, live changes or user-record deletion. Canonical editing ownership released at handoff; runner lock retained.
